### NLP Basics:

feature engineering: The process of creating new features and/or transforming existing features to get the most out of your data

lemmatizing: The process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single term

root cause: The earliest underlying factor contributing to a problem

NLP: Acronym for “Natural Language Processing” that refers to the field concerned with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language

NLTK: Acronym for “natural language toolkit” and is the most utilized package for handling natural language processing tasks in Python; open-source tools created for the purpose of making NLP process in Python easier

regular expressions: A text string used for describe a certain search pattern; also known as a “regex”

stemming: The process of reducing inflection or derived words to their word stem or root; crudely chopping off the ends of a word to leave only the base

stop words: Commonly used words like “but,” “if,” “the,” etc.

tokenizing: The process of splitting some string or sentence into a list of words

vectorizing: The process of encoding text as integers to create feature vectors


### Advanced NLP with Python for Machine Learning

Anaconda: A highly efficient tool to access documentation
NLP:  Natural language processing; the study of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, and their interactions with computers and human language

RNN: Recurrent neural network; a method that uses the output of one function 
as the input of another.

Shallow, fully connected, feed forward neural network: A neural network type that contains the three layers: inputs, hidden, and outputs

Tokenization The splitting of a string or sentence into a list of words for further 
evaluation

Vectorized text Converting text into numerical values to compute it
